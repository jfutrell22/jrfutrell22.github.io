  		Hey! My name is John Futrell. I am currently working on a Web Development certificate at Wake Tech Community College. In 2013 I graduated with my bachelors in Agricultural and Environmental Technology. The last 9 years I have been working in the field of air quality and I am now transitioning into the world of Web Development.  
	</p>
	<p class="pHome">
		At Wake Tech I have taken several classes that have exposed me to various aspects of web development. I’ve had experience writing in HTML, CSS, C#, and Java Script. 
	</p>
	<p class="pHome">
		In my studies I’ve become familiar with a variety of software programs such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, WordPress, FileZilla (a FTP software tool) and various programs from Adobes creative suite. I will keep adding to this list as my experience grows.
